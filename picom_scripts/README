// TOGGLE TRANSPARENCY

This is a Python script that goes through the .config/picom/picom.conf replacing previous set strings.

Should be installed using a symlink in /bin or /usr/bin for dmenu to be used.

    # ln -s /full/path/to/script /usr/bin/

Make sure the targets and replacements variables have exactly the same lines as found in .config/picom/picom.conf
This program needs updating if any of the used variables in the configuration file get changed.

Unintall: Just delete the /bin/transparency or /usr/bin/transparency symlink.

NOTE: Its advised to create backup of the config file before using the script.
